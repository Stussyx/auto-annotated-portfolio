For our capstone project, we developed a Research Archiving System for ICI-College. The system was designed to streamline the organization, storage, and retrieval of research materials, helping students, faculty, and staff easily access academic resources. The project involved researching the existing needs of the institution, designing an intuitive user interface, and implementing a backend system for efficient archiving and searching of research documents. The system also allows for easy categorization and tagging, making it easier to organize vast amounts of academic data. This project not only improved the accessibility of research within the college but also enhanced the overall efficiency of managing and sharing academic work across the institution.
