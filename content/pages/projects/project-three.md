  I developed a Point of Sale (POS) system as part of my app development
  project. The POS system is designed to streamline sales transactions, track
  inventory, and generate reports, offering a user-friendly interface for
  efficient management in retail environments.

My app development project focused on creating a Point of Sale (POS) system, which was developed progressively over several grading periods, from the first term through the finals. The project began in the last semester of my third year and became the final project in the first semester of my fourth year. Throughout this time, I worked on gradually improving both the design and the code, incorporating feedback and refining the system. The initial stages involved laying the groundwork for the core functionality, such as sales transactions and inventory tracking. As the project advanced, I enhanced the user interface, added reporting features, and optimized performance, ultimately delivering a fully functional and efficient POS system. This project not only demonstrated my technical skills but also my ability to iterate and improve a system over time, making it a key learning experience during my academic journey.
