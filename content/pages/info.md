      Hello, I'm James Luis S. Legaspi, a passionate and detail-oriented
      graduate of Immaculate Conception International College, where I earned my
      Bachelor of Science in Information Systems. My academic journey, combined
      with hands-on experience, has equipped me with a solid foundation in
      programming, database management, and information systems. During my
      internship at San Gabriel Rural Waterworks and Development Cooperative, I
      developed valuable technical and organizational skills, such as data
      encoding, documentation, and system record management. This experience not
      only honed my ability to work with technology but also reinforced my
      commitment to precision and quality in every task.
